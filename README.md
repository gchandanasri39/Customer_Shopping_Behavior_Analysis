# Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Business Insights

## Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from raw data ingestion to business insights. It involves data loading and analysis using Python, data cleaning and exploration, querying data across multiple SQL databases, and visualizing insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The final insights are summarized in a structured report and presentation.
